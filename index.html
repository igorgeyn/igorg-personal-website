        <section class="intro">
            <p class="lead">Hello! My name is Igor. I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

            <p>I'm a data scientist and quantitative researcher specializing in causal inference using large data sets, advanced econometric methods, complicated data pipelines, and machine learning. I defended my dissertation and received my PhD from UCLA in February 2026.</p>

            <p><b>I am currently on the (non-academic) job market exploring ways to make an impact using my skills as a researcher, analyst, and experienced business professional.</b> If you are interested in connecting, I am available via LinkedIn, email, and Twitter/X.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="current">
            <h2>Current Work</h2>

            <p>I'm helping several companies and organizations with causal inference and statistical analysis, including as a part-time economist with <a href="https://www.burningglassinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Burning Glass Institute</a>, where my work helps answer questions about the future of work, the impact of AI on demand for skills, and various regional workforce programs.</p>
        </section>


        <section class="recent-summary">
        <h2>Summary of Recent Experience</h2>

        My dissertation uses real-world, non-lab data and causal research methods (regression discontinuity design, diff in diff, and other methods) to provide concrete answers to long-standing questions:

            <ul>
                <li>Does attending college make people more active citizens? (Yes, by quite a bit.)</li>
                <li>Does direct democracy create a more informed electorate? (It depends on how you measure it, but probably not.)</li>
                <li>Is the administration of U.S. elections fair or biased in a partisan way? (Fair, but it matters who is in office.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I also teach statistics and data science/research methods to high school students, college students, and working professionals.</p>
            <!-- <p>For each of the above, I also show <b>why</b> and <b>by how much</b>.</p> -->

            <p>
                <!-- Through half a decade of pre-grad school experience and dozens of academic and industry projects during my PhD, I have touched nearly every aspect of the analytical pipeline, including the parts that have almost nothing to do with code: stakeholder management, task scoping, people management, and more. -->
                I've been lucky enough to develop my data skillset alongside growth in the industry overall; I've worked in every type of infrastructure/computing environment from scattered Excel workbooks to robust, integrated cloud pipelines. <b>This has required me to learn a lot more than just coding and analysis: stakeholder management, task scoping, people management, and generally how to make do with what you have while working/building towards a better future state.</b> Some examples of my project-level achievements follow.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Managing a team of researchers to execute the flagship research product at the public sector division of Atlantic Media.</li>
                <li>Piloting and executing the first explicitly causal analysis of wildfire prevention programs at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E).</li>
                <li>Launching the first political science program at UCLA to teach undergraduates research skills by pairing them with high-quality, in-flight graduate research projects and teaching modern-day research methods.</li>
            </ul>

        </section>
        <!-- <section class="background">
            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>I got my taste for social science (and decided to pursue a PhD) after about half a decade getting my feet wet as a researcher at a health workforce institute in San Francisco and at several companies in Washington, D.C. focused on government technology, defense, and professional services. I have spent time as a freelance journalist, people manager, philanthropic organizer, assistant caterer, and many other roles.</p>

        <section class="job-market">
            <h2>Job Market Interests</h2>

            <p>I'm broadly interested in <b>quant research and data science opportunities on the product and policy/regulatory sides of for-profit/industry organizations</b>, including in technology but also other domains. (I'm interpreting "product" very broadly: this can include services, consulting, internal strategy, etc. as outputs.) I've previously worked in government contracting/consulting, marketing and market research, the energy and utility space, ride share/micromobility, and health.</p>
            
            <!-- <p>The day-to-day can include building and running A/B tests for product improvements, deploying lift tests and other marketing analyses, cost-benefit and risk calculations, satisfying (and reducing burden from) regulatory/compliance requirements, and just about anything else tied to careful, rigorous analysis of  data whether it's nice and tidy or terribly messy.</p>

            <p>I am also a practiced and comfortable presenter, and can work with non-technical folks to translate business problems into specific analyses.</p> -->


            <p>Some job titles I've used in the past: <b>data scientist, senior data scientist, researcher, applied researcher, data analyst, senior data analyst, and applied data scientist.</b></p>
