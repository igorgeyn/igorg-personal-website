            <p class="lead">Hello! My name is Igor. I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
            
            <p>I'm a data scientist and social science researcher specializing in causal inference using large data sets, advanced econometric methods, complicated data pipelines (including non-traditional data sources), and machine learning.</p>
            
            <p>My PhD research focuses on answering local political economy questions such as "do partisan elections lead to biased election results?" (they haven't), "does going to college cause attendees to participate in politics?" (it does), and "can/do voters learn from local ballot measures and propositions?" (work in progress, early results suggest small/negligible effects under some specifications).</p>

        <section class="current">
            <h2>Current Work</h2>
            
            <p>I'm currently helping several companies and organizations with causal inference and statistical analysis, including as a part-time economist with <a href="https://www.burningglassinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Burning Glass Institute</a>, where my work helps answer questions about the future of work, the impact of AI on demand for skills, and various client-specific workforce programs.</p>
            
            <p>Last academic year (2024–25), I used a leave of absence to build automated tools for risk analysis and perform causal analysis of wildfire mitigation programs at Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E), one of the nation's largest investor-owned utilities and a company that went through a wildfire-related bankruptcy in 2019–2020.</p>

        <section class="background">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            
            <p>I got my taste for social science (and decided to pursue a PhD) after about half a decade getting my feet wet as a researcher at a health workforce institute in San Francisco and at several companies in Washington, D.C. focused on government technology, defense, and professional services. I have spent time as a freelance journalist, people manager, philanthropic organizer, assistant caterer, and many other roles.</p>

        <section class="job-market">
            <h2>Job Market Interests</h2>
            
            <p>I'm interested in combining my skills in causal inference and rigorous statistical analysis with a deep curiosity in improving safe, ethical decisionmaking (whether the decisions are made by machines or people). Specifically, I am interested in using code to make inference better and faster, and to integrate an externality-conscious framework into the development of inference at scale.</p>
            
            <p>Some common job titles include: data scientist, senior data scientist, researcher, applied researcher, data analyst, senior data analyst, and applied data scientist.</p>
