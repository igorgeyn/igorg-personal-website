Across a series of bite-sized, public-facing articles, we leveraged (1) publicly available data, (2) original analysis including geocoding and predictive analytics, and (3) numerous FOIA requests to produce the first publicly available snapshots of supply/demand, race/ethnicity and other demographics, and geographic distribution of D.C. health providers to date.</p>
